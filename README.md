# DiscordBotInPython
Simple Discord Bot in Python


This is a code written in Python, it has a lot to add since I was using it for my server bot, as I said it still has a lot to write, since here is a script in its infancy, as it is the base of my discord bot , I will not release the current code, but I will continue applying changes to it, my goal is to encourage the development of discord bots in this wonderful programming language, I clarify this bot is free and any change and modification is fully allowed

# Install

To install the bot you must call the library discord.py

*first*

```pip install discord.py```
[See documentation](https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/)

# Used Libs

```import datetime```
